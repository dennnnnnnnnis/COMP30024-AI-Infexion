# COMP30024-AI-Infexion
Agents playing Infexion game! 

# Important
This is an University of Melbourne COMP30024 Artificial Intelligence assignment, game Infexion is specific to the assignment only. It is only there to demonstration the implementation of the adverserial search algorithm by the author. External or personal use of the code is strictly not allowed. 

# Game Rules
You can find the rules to the game here [Rules](https://github.com/dennnnnnnnnis/COMP30024-AI-Infexion/blob/main/AI_2023_Infexion_Rules.pdf)

# Implementation
Minimax tree and Monte Carlo algorithms are all implemented, with an attempt of the Neural Network in helping to make the move of an agent (possible but not fully implemented here).
